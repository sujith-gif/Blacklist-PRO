== Usage ==
Once activated, BLACKLIST-PRO adds three submenus to the WordPress admin dashboard:

1. **Add New Customer**: Navigate to this submenu to add details of a fraud user. Here, you can enter information such as name, email, IP address, and any other relevant details.

2. **View Customers**: Use this submenu to view a list of blacklisted customers and their details. You can search, filter, and manage blacklisted customers from this page.

3. **Blacklist IP**: This submenu allows you to blacklist specific IP addresses associated with fraudulent activity. You can manually add or remove IP addresses from the blacklist.

Additionally, BLACKLIST-PRO integrates with WooCommerce. When a customer places an order, BLACKLIST-PRO checks if the customer's details match any entries in the blacklist. If a match is found, the order is marked as blacklisted. You can view blacklisted orders in the WooCommerce orders section.

BLACKLIST-PRO provides customization options to configure settings such as notification preferences, order handling, and blacklist management. These options can be accessed from the plugin settings page in the WordPress admin dashboard.
